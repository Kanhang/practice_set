// given two arrays and a value of k. The first array represents
// the price of the stock on the day, and the second represents
// whether it was bought (0) or sold (1) that day. According to
// the given buying and selling settings, the maximum benefit 
//will not be obtained. To optimize this algorithm, it is to 
//change the second array to change some of the purchases into 
//selling, forming a continuous k-day selling. Return the final
// k-day profit from the above excercise.

// [1,5,3,2,5,6]
// output should be [0,1,]
